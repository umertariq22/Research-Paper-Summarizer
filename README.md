# 🧠 Research Paper Summarizer

This project is a transformer-based system that generates concise and readable summaries of academic research papers. It's designed to reduce the time spent on manual literature reviews by leveraging fine-tuned transformer models.

## 🚀 Features

- Fine-tunes transformer models like **BERT** and **T5** for summarization
- Handles domain-specific datasets of academic papers
- Converts dense technical content into readable summaries
- Ideal for researchers, students, and analysts who want to skim through papers efficiently

## 📁 Project Structure

- `research-paper-summarizer.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with training, evaluation, and summarization pipeline
- `data/` — (Assumed) directory containing preprocessed or raw academic paper datasets

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy

## 📊 Model Details

- Uses transformer-based architectures (e.g., T5) for text summarization
- Supports full fine-tuning or LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) based tuning
- Evaluation based on ROUGE and manual qualitative analysis

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
